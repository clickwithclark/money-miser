<h2> Brief </h2>

* This application was written in javascript and designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

* Instead of a backend I decided to use localstorage from the web storage API that maintains a separate storage area for each given url that's available and allows the data saved to persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.

* A service worker was installed but only to allow the application to be downloadable and allowed to run as a mobile app when needed, a caching strategy was not as important here. 

* I used the react frontend library just to understand how state and prop-drilling works but this application is very lightweight that it could have been written with javascript alone.
